In standard equilibrium physics, interactions are almost always reciprocal. If Particle A pushes Particle B, Particle B pushes back with equal force. This is Newton's Third Law, and it allows us to define conserved quantities like momentum and energy.

But biology does not care about Newton's Third Law.

In my current research on **Active Matter**, I am investigating systems where the force from A to B is not equal to the negative force from B to A. These are **non-reciprocal interactions**, and they are the secret engine behind some of nature's most complex self-organizing systems.

### The Predator-Prey Archetype

The simplest way to understand non-reciprocity is the relationship between a predator and its prey.
* **The Predator** is attracted to the Prey.
* **The Prey** is repelled by the Predator.

In a conservative physical system, this would be impossible; forces are gradients of a shared potential energy. But in active matter, each agent consumes energy individually. This breaks the symmetry. The result is a constant pursuit, a non-equilibrium steady state where the system never settles down into a static configuration.

### From Chasing to Time-Crystals

When we scale this up from two particles to thousands, the behavior becomes fascinatingly complex. In my Master's thesis work, we model these interactions using **Overdamped Langevin Dynamics** with generalized interaction matrices.

We observe that as the degree of non-reciprocity increases, the system undergoes phase transitions that don't exist in passive matter:

1.  **Traveling Waves:** Density fluctuations that propagate through the crowd like sound waves.
2.  **Chiral Phases:** Spontaneous rotation of clusters purely due to the non-reciprocal forces.
3.  **Time-Crystalline Order:** Patterns that repeat in time, not just in space.

### Biological Relevance

Non-reciprocity is fundamental to living tissue:
* **Neural Networks:** Excitatory and inhibitory neurons create asymmetric loops.
* **Chemotaxis:** Bacteria create and follow chemical trails.
* **Immune Response:** Immune cells chasing pathogens.

### Conclusion

My research aims to quantify these transitions. By mapping the phase diagram of non-reciprocal active matter, we hope to understand the generic rules that allow biological agents to form smart, resilient structures.
