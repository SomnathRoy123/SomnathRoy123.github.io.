## 1. Introduction: The Star-Formation Structure Problem

Young Stellar Objects (YSOs) encode the recent history of star formation and environmental feedback in molecular clouds. The Orion region is particularly rich in structure, where clustering, sub-clustering, and density variation can reveal signatures of underlying physical processes.

This project develops a reproducible analysis workflow to move from raw catalog-level data to interpretable structural diagnostics.

## 2. Methodology: Quantifying Spatial Organization

The repository focuses on turning astrophysical survey-style data into rigorous, visualizable structure metrics.

### Pipeline design

- Curate and clean YSO coordinate/property data for consistent downstream computation.
- Compute structure-aware statistics to identify concentration patterns and sub-regions.
- Generate comparative visualizations that expose morphology and density variation across Orion fields.

### Analysis philosophy

Rather than relying on one-off plots, the code is organized for repeatability so that updated catalogs or parameter choices can be reprocessed with minimal manual intervention.

## 3. Outcomes

- Built a reusable analysis framework for YSO structure characterization.
- Improved interpretability of Orion-region organization through standardized figures and diagnostics.
- Enabled rapid iteration between hypothesis testing and quantitative validation.

## 4. Research Relevance for PhD Applications

This repository demonstrates readiness for interdisciplinary research where **domain science + computation + reproducibility** all matter. It reflects the practical ability to handle noisy real-world data while preserving physical interpretability, an important skill for modern astrophysics and data-intensive physics research.
