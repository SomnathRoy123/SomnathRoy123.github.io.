I am a theoretical physicist driven by a deep fascination with **non-equilibrium statistical mechanics** and **computational biophysics**. My research investigates how complex, collective behaviors emerge in active systems through the lenses of hydrodynamic field theories and non-reciprocal interactions.

Currently, I am bridging the gap between analytical theory and advanced computation. I specialize in developing **Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs)** to solve intricate hydrodynamic equations and designing **Langevin dynamics simulations** to model Active Brownian Particles (ABPs).

### Research Focus

* **Non-Reciprocal Interactions:** exploring the breakdown of Newton’s third law in active mixtures.
* **Hydrodynamic Field Theories:** deriving continuum equations for biological active matter.
* **Machine Learning in Physics:** utilizing PINNs for solving high-dimensional PDEs in fluid dynamics.

I completed my **Integrated Master’s in Physics** at **IISER Kolkata**, with thesis research conducted at **TU Berlin**. I am currently seeking a PhD position to continue pushing the boundaries of active matter physics.
