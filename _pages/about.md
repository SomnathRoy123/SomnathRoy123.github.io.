I am a **theoretical physicist** investigating how collective behaviour emerges in driven and living active matter. My work combines statistical physics, continuum theory, and computational modelling to derive mechanistic descriptions that connect microscopic interactions to macroscopic dynamics. More broadly, I seek a multiscale physical understanding of living systems — from molecular activity to cellular organisation and collective motion — with the long-term goal of enabling bottom-up construction and control of life-like active materials.


Currently, I am a **Visiting Student Researcher at TU Berlin**, working on **non-equilibrium statistical mechanics**. My research investigates how microscopic asymmetries—such as internal torques, non‑reciprocal couplings, or activity gradients—produce large‑scale structure and transport in active matter systems. I primarily employ **hydrodynamic field theories** and **coarse‑grained Langevin dynamics** to understand these behaviors.


Beyond my current focus, I have a strong background in scientific machine learning. I have previously developed and applied **Physics‑Informed Neural Networks (PINNs)** to solve high-dimensional PDEs and infer effective parameters in fluid dynamics. My broader toolkit includes stochastic simulation, continuum theory, and data-driven inverse methods.

### Research Focus

* **Non‑equilibrium Statistical Mechanics:** Analyzing how violations of detailed balance and action–reaction at the microscopic scale alter phase behaviour and transport.
* **Hydrodynamic Field Theories:** Deriving continuum equations for biological and synthetic active media.
* **Machine Learning for Physics:** Leveraging PINNs and data‑driven methods to solve complex dynamical systems (part of my computational toolkit).
* **Coarse‑grained Modelling:** Constructing particle‑based models (active polymers, ABPs) calibrated to experimental observations.
