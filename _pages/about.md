Somnath Roy Master’s in Physics | IISER Kolkata

I am a theoretical physicist specialized in Statistical Mechanics and Active Matter. My research focuses on the collective behavior of non-equilibrium systems, specifically exploring hydrodynamic field theories and non-reciprocal interactions in active systems.

Currently, I am bridging the gap between traditional theoretical physics and modern computational techniques. I am actively developing Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) to solve complex hydrodynamic equations and modeling Active Brownian Particles (ABP) to understand the emergence of order in biological and synthetic systems.
