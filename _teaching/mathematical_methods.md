## Course Overview
* **Instructor:** Prof. Rajesh Kumble Nayak
* **Role:** Teaching Assistant
* **Year:** 2023 - 2024
* **Credits:** 3.0 (Theory)
* **Level:** 2

This course provides the mathematical framework necessary for advanced physical sciences, focusing on both analytical and numerical techniques.

### Teaching Assistantship Details
In this role, I assisted **Prof. Rajesh Kumble Nayak** in delivering the course content for level 2 students. My responsibilities included:
* **Tutorial Management**: Leading sessions to solve complex problems in PDEs and Fourier analysis.
* **Numerical Demonstrations**: Guiding students through the implementation of Root-finding and ODE solvers.
* **Student Mentorship**: Providing 1-on-1 support for the probability and statistics modules.

### Course Schedule
| Week | Topic | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Part I** | **Partial Differential Equations** | Separation of Variables, classification, and solving Laplace/Poisson equations. |
| **Part II** | **Fourier Series** | Fourier coefficients, summation of series, and function expansion. |
| **Part III** | **Probability & Statistics** | Bayes' theorem, central limit theorem, and statistical measures. |
| **Part IV** | **Numerical Methods** | Root finding (Newton-Raphson), solving ODEs (Runge-Kutta), and interpolation. |
